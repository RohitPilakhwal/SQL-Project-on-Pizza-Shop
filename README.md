# SQL-Project-on-Pizza-Shop
In this project, I analyzed a pizza shop's dataset with advanced SQL queries to extract key metrics such as sales revenue, order trends, and customer preferences. Using joins, subqueries, and window functions, I transformed raw data into actionable insights, showcasing my SQL skills and supporting strategic planning.
